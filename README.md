# aquifer-run
After you build an aquifer project there are many commands you need to run to update your build to reflect the state of your codebase (examples: `drush updb` and `drush rr`). This extension allows you to define those commands in your aquifer.json file and run them with a single command: `aquifer run`.

## Installation
To install aquifer-run, run the below command from within your Aquifer project:

```bash
aquifer extension-add aquifer-run
```

## Use
@TODO: add usage documentation.
